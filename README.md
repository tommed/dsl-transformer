## About

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Graphical representation of Ducto manipulate streaming data in a system of pipes" 
       src="./assets/ducto-representation-small.png"/>
</p>

`dsl-transformer` is a lightweight, embeddable data transformation engine designed for structured data (JSON, maps, structs). Transformations are defined using a DSL (JSON or HCL-based), making it suitable for use cases like:

- Event stream manipulation
- API response mutation
- ETL pipelines
- Testing tools and CLI automation

It is:
- âš¡ Minimal
- ðŸŸ£ Composable
- ðŸŸ© Fully testable

`dsl-transformer` is a part of the larger [Ducto project](https://github.com/tommed), combining many interesting practices together including Feature Flagging.

## Example

### `examples/simplest.json`

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "instructions": [
    {"op": "set", "key": "greeting", "value": "hello world"}
  ]
}
```

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/tommed/ducto-dsl/cmd/ducto-dsl@latest

# Run from a file
ducto-dsl program.json < input.json
# Or piping stdout into stdin
echo '{"foo": "bar"}' | ducto-dsl program.json

# Lint
ducto-dsl lint program.json
```

## From Source

### Lint

```bash
go run ./cmd/ducto-cli lint examples/simplest.json
```

### Run

```bash
echo '{"foo":"bar"}' | go run ./cmd/ducto-cli ./examples/simplest.json
```

#### Output:

```json
{
  "foo": "bar",
  "greeting": "hello world"
}

```
